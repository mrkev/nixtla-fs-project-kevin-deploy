# Open Source Tracker üöÄ

> A platform for tracking and predicting the future trends of open-source projects using TimeGPT. This is part of Nixtla's technical assessment for Full Stack Developer candidates.

## Technical Project for the Full Stack Developer Role

### Welcome! üëã

We are excited to have you participate in this technical project, designed to assess your ability to deploy a comprehensive application, simulating a real-world working scenario with us. Your primary task is to develop a Website that enables open-source companies to monitor their traction. It's similar to [star-history](https://star-history.com/), but with additional features. This project will be open-sourced, and you'll receive public recognition for your contribution.

### Your Challenge üèÜ

Your task is to create a Website (dashboard) that tracks the performance of open-source projects, specifically focusing on the history of GitHub stars and Python package download statistics. This platform should enable users to:

1. **Add Entire GitHub Organizations:** Unlike the example website, which focuses only on individual repositories, your platform should display the cumulative star history for all repositories within a GitHub organization. For instance, to view the star history of the entire [Nixtla](https://github.com/Nixtla) organization, one should be able to input its URL directly, rather than adding each repository individually.

2. **Include Multiple Organizations/Repositories:** Users should be able to compare the star history of multiple organizations and repositories on a single dashboard, unlike the example website that limits comparison to individual repositories.

3. **Show Historical Download Stats:** The dashboard should also display historical download statistics for Python packages associated with the selected repositories or organizations, linking to sources like [pepy.tech](https://pepy.tech/). If a GitHub repository and its corresponding Python package have different names, the platform should appropriately indicate an error.

4. **Forecast Future Trends:** Incorporate our company‚Äôs forecasting API, TimeGPT, to predict future trends in star history and download statistics. Your dashboard should present both historical data and future forecasts generated using [our API](https://docs.nixtla.io/).

Consider adding features like growth rates for enhanced functionality.

### Time Frame ‚è≥

You have one week from the date of receiving this test to complete and submit your project. Your one-week period starts upon receiving access to the repository.

### This is a Work Simulation, Not Just a Test

Throughout the week, feel free to ask us questions and schedule meetings as needed. This exercise aims to understand how you'll integrate into our workflow. You'll also get a sense of our working style.

### Technology Preferences üí°

- **Technology Agnostic:** You may use any technology stack for coding and deployment. We have previously used TypeScript, JavaScript, and Vercel for similar applications.
- **Deployment Requirement:** Ensure the deployed webpage is publicly accessible. If you choose a paid service, we'll cover the costs.

### What We Are Looking For üîç

- **Solution-Oriented Focus:** Create something engaging and useful.
- **Code Quality:** Your code should be clean, well-documented, and maintainable.
- **Design Thinking:** Aim for an efficient, user-centric design.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** Show us how you tackle unexpected challenges.
- **Creativity:** We value innovative ideas and approaches!

### How to Proceed üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Create Your Own Branch:** Start by cloning this repository and working on your branch.

2. **Readme File:** Document your methodology, technologies used, and instructions for running the application in the README file.

3. **Submit Your Work:** Complete your project and submit a pull request to the main branch.

### Open Source Contribution üåê

This technical test offers an opportunity to contribute to the open-source community:

- **Choice to Share:** You may choose to open-source the code developed during this test, making your work available for public use, modification, and distribution.
- **No Impact on Hiring Decision:** Your decision to open-source your project will not influence our evaluation of your performance or our hiring decision.

The choice to open-source your project is entirely yours, and we respect and support whatever decision you make.

### Support ü§ù

- **Questions:** For any queries or clarifications, feel free to open an issue in the repository.
- **Feedback:** We are here to support you and will provide constructive feedback on your submission.

### Remember üåü

- This test is about demonstrating your skills, creativity, and problem-solving approach.
- We value your effort and time. Feel free to include any additional skills or functionalities you believe would be beneficial.
- This is a safe and encouraging environment. Embrace this opportunity to showcase your abilities!

Good luck! We can't wait to see what you create! üöÄüéâ
